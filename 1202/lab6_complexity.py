# Lab 6 - Algorithm Performance Analysis
# This lab is designed to help you understand time complexities:
# 
#    O(N), O(N log N), and O(N^2).
#
# Instructions:
# 1) Run the code and observe the output. Note: The last two columns should be
#    approximately the same initially.
# 2) Modify the function `duplicateSearchSorted()` so that its time complexity is O(N).
# 3) Re-run the code. The last column values should now be significantly smaller than the
#    third column.
# 4) Modify the outer loop to include larger values of `numElements` (you can increment
#    by larger steps than 2000). Continue increasing until the last row takes at least a
#    minute to run. (This threshold may vary depending on processor speed.)
# 5) In your group, determine the time complexity of sections 2, 3, 4, and 5.
#    Are they O(N), O(N log N), or O(N^2)?
# 6) Write a short report and upload it. The report should include:
#     A) Your modified `duplicateSearchSorted()` function.
#     B) Output showing performance after modification, with `numElements` set high
#        enough that the sum of all four columns in the last row is at least one minute.
#     C) Explanation of the time complexity of the algorithms in sections 2, 3, 4, and 5,
#        with justification.

######################## Code Execution: Running the Experiments ########################
# The outer loop runs the entire experiment for increasing values of N (numElements).
# Inside the outer loop, the code is divided into five sections:

# Section 1: Create a list of random integers.
#            - The range of generated numbers is 10,000 times the number of elements.
#            - This ensures relatively few duplicate values in the list.
# Section 2: Perform 'numElements' linear searches.
# Section 3: Perform 'numElements' binary searches.
# Section 4: Run duplicateSearch() to find duplicates in the unsorted list.
# Section 5: Run duplicateSearchSorted() to find duplicates in the sorted list.
#            - This function needs to be optimized to take advantage of sorting.
#            - Currently, it performs the same as duplicateSearch() and must be improved.
