# COMP1352 - Introduction to Programming II

This folder contains the following projects:
- [**Conga Line Simulator**](/1352/projects/morgan_conga_line.py)
A simulation representing a Conga Line, demonstrating the principles of classes and lists of objects where each object represents a circle in the line.

- [**Pico Fermi Bagels**](/1352/projects/morgan_pico_fermi_bagels.py)
A guessing game where the player tries to guess a secret number based on the hints 'Pico', 'Fermi', and 'Bagels' that indicate how close their guess is.

- [**Sand Game**](/1352/projects/morgan_project3part2_sandgame.py)
A physics simulation that models the behavior of sand particles falling, colliding, and interacting with other elements in a grid-based environment.

- [**Fair Districting Visualizer**](/1352/projects/morgan_project5_fair_districting.py)
A project that attempts to model fair districting for electoral purposes, using graph theory and clustering techniques to evaluate district boundaries.

- [**Particle Playground**](/1352/projects/morgan_project6_particles.py)
A particle simulation that includes various types of particles with different behaviors, such as acceleration, bouncing, and color-changing effects. It also supports firework-like displays and interactive elements.

- [**Wordle Remix**](/1352/projects/morgan_wordle.py)
A Wordle-like game where the user attempts to guess a five-letter word within six tries. The game provides color-coded feedback (green, yellow, gray) to indicate correctness and letter positioning.
