# COMP1353 - Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms I

This folder contains the following projects:
- [**Algorithm Insight**](/1353/projects/algorithm_analysis.py)
A program designed to analyze the complexity and performance of different algorithms, including sorting, searching, and optimization methods. It includes complexity comparisons and runtime evaluations.

- [**Percolation Pathfinder**](/1353/projects/morgan_percolation.py)
This project simulates the spread of fire through a forest to determine if a full spread path exists. It graphically demonstrates how different densities of trees impact the probability of complete ignition.

- [**Retro Snake Game**](/1353/projects/snake.py)
A recreation of the classic Snake game, implemented with simple graphics and collision detection. The game supports real-time movement and collision-based game-over conditions.
